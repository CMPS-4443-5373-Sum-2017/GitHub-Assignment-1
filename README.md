1.  If you do not already have one, create a Github account.
2.  Create a repository named, "SW-Tools-Sum17-yourlastname" (replace yourlastname with your actual last name)
3.  Check the box that says: "Add a README.md file"
4.  Edit the README.md to include the following information:

      ##1\)  Your first and last name in heading format.  
      2\)  An image (preferably of you, but not required).  
      3\)  Any software packages/tools that you either find helpful or would like to learn.
    
There are several YouTube videos on editing readme files and adding images.  Here is one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHbWF1Bvgf4 

That's it.  Easy as Pie/Pi!
