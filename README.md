1.  If you do not already have one, create a Github account.
2.  Create a repository named, "SW-Tools-Sum17-yourlastname" (replace yourlastname with your actual last name)
3.  Check the box that says: "Add a README.md file"
4.  Edit the README.md to include the following information:

   1)  ## Your first and last name in heading format.
   2)  An image (preferably of you, but not required).
